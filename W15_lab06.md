Ways to improve build file:
     - I fixed the jar task, added a description, and ensured that it shows up when one does ant -p

Ways to improve the readme:
	  - Update the picture of the game
	  - Add more detail to the high-level description
	  - Add actual project history or remove project history section it currently doesn't have any project history



Bugs:
	- Does not run properly on putty (perhaps due to lag, or maybe it just flat-out doesn't work)

Ways to improve the game:
     - Add detail to instructions at the beginning of the game
     - Add option to replay game after dying
     - Perhaps make a main screen where you have options for playing the game, checking hiscores, viewing instructions, etc., and after the player dies after a game they are brought back to the main screen.
     - Make it possible to sustain a long game by implementing items
       - note: there are some item classes created but they have not been implemented in the main engine yet; there is also a test file for the items
       

Ways to improve the test files:
     - GamePieceTest.java only tests the constructors of the game pieces
       -note: GamePiece is an interface which is implemented by all classes representing the pieces that show up on the screen (player, monsters, and items)
     - SubMonsterTest.java only tests the constructor, getter, and setter  methods of each of the monster classes that implement GamePiece
     - We can write methods that make sure all the methods of the game pieces work.

Ways to clean up the code:

Comments on current issues:
	 -After having run the game multiple times, I have not experienced the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception
	 -I agree that the items should be added to the game.
	 -I agree that the game description should be more detailed and instructive.
	 -I agree that it would be nice to have a GUI menu.
