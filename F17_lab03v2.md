#(a) Description

The game starts with the player being a black room, leaving him/her to explore the cave. The player will find illuminated parts of the cave such as walls and corridors, and will also find monsters, of which the player needs to move on top of to defeat. Once all monsters are defeated in the cave, the player advances to the next level.

#(b) Current User Stories

1. As a player I can move around the cave with the "WASD" keys so that I can explore the cave and kill monsters.

2. As a player I can kill monsters to (if I kill all monsters) proceed to the next level.

3. As a player I can lose all my health to stop playing and get my high score.

4. As a player I can pick up monster drops by moving onto it to restore my health, decrease my health, or increase my attack power.

5. As a player I can compare my score with previous scores to be more competitive.

6. As a player I can illuminate the cave by exploring the cave to see what the map looks like and where the enemies are.

#(c) Assessment of Status of Software

The software runs. At the main screen you can play the game, look at some instructions, look at high scores, and you can quit the program. The last three are self explanatory. Once you hit play you start at the top left corner of the room, with only a small chunk of the room illuminated where you are. When you move, more of the room becomes illuminated, revealing walls, corridors, and monsters. You can move around freely except you can't go through walls, and you can move on top of monsters to kill them. If they drop items you can pick them up, but the effects are explicitly shown. Once all monsters are killed you move on to the next level starting off how you original started when you first clicked start, just with harder game settings.

#(d) Future User Stories

1. As a player, I should not be able to see through walls to be realistic.

2. As a player, the walls should have some sort of texture or graphics instead of just "0's" to have a better user experience.

3. As a player, the monsters I fight should have some design instead of just a letter to have a better user experience.

4. As a player, I should be able to see all my stats like attack power etc. to have a reference of how I am doing

5. As a player I should have to fight a boss once all the monsters are dead before advancing, to make the game more fun.

6. As a player, there should be a better way to engage in combat other than going on top of monsters, maybe a sort of ranged weapon instead or a sword to swing.


#(e) README Assessment
The README has good documentation, illustrations and background on the game, as well as descriptions that give you a good sense of what the project is, the goal, and all the details of the rules of the game. It also does a good job of giving an overview of some of the methods and how they interact. What would benefit future programs is a more detailed description on the methods not just a superficial view. There could also be more descriptions on the difference between the monsters. Overall good documentation.

#(f) build.xml Assessment
The build.xml is also well done, all targets have decent descriptions, some could be less ambiguous like "run the RougueController".

#(g) Assessment of Issues
There are enough issues to make up 1000 points. The major issues are refactoring the code, adding AI to the monsters, and fixing the line of sight issues. These can get us up to 650 points, so the various minor issues like GUI and new features should be enough to get us up to 1000.


#(h) New Issues
[Bad Menu GUI (#82)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-roguelike/issues/82)
[Sound Issues (#83)](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-roguelike/issues/83)

#(i) Assessment of Code
There are a lot of different classes for this project. Most of these classes are straightforward and simple. LogicEngine and RogueController, however, are long and confusing. They will need heavy refactoring, which may mean most of the code will end up being re-written. They will likely be broken up into multiple subclasses, each of which will handle one specific task. In order to get someone up to speed on the code, I would give someone an explanation of LogicEngine and RogueController's functionalities.

#(j) Assessment of Testing
There is test code written for the basic classes and some of simpler functions in LogicEngine.However, it will likely require more test coverage given the size of the project. I would test each of the different interactions a player can have with a monster or wall so that every possibility is accounted for.
