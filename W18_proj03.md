#132 : (250points)Find and fix the game-breaking freezing bug: Good Luck! We think it is in the map generation portion of the code, but we are not sure.

#133 : (250points) Better map generation: Come up with a better map generation algorithm, get creative! Make some generic layouts for some levels maybe that would make the game harder at certain points. Bonus points if this fixes the freezing bug.

#134 : (100points) Better error messaging: refactor and recomment the code to catch exceptions and errors and present them well in the main canvas.

#135 : ((100points) Fix messaging to prevent overlapping messages: Messaging in the canvas sometimes overlaps, especially in the item messaging. Fix this so that only one message shows at a time.

#136 : (50points) Show the difficulty of the games somewhere on the canvas: easy but good feature.

#137 : (200points) Add a progression of difficulty system: Make it so that monsters get harder as the levels get higher, and make them worth more points as levels go on.

#138 : (100points) Add name to high scores list: If I get the new high score, I wanna make sure everyone knows! Make it so that you can have your name gets put on the scoreboard if you get a top five finish.
